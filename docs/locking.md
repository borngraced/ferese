# Lock screen

Ferese Lock follows your desktop wallpaper, colors, font, and shell corners.
Open **Settings → Lock screen** to change its clock, date, wallpaper softness,
and inactivity delays.

## Preview and lock

```sh
ferese-lock --preview      # ordinary window; does not lock or check passwords
ferese-lock                # lock; returns after compositor confirmation
ferese-lock --foreground   # stay attached until unlock
```

Do not enter your real password in a preview. The account picture comes from
AccountsService or `~/.face`; a silhouette is used when neither is available.

Press Escape to clear the password. The authentication status also shows whether
Caps Lock is on. A failed attempt displays an error and delays the next retry.
Authentication uses the system's PAM policy; both password and account validation must succeed.

## Automatic locking

Install `swayidle`, then add this to `~/.config/ferese/config.kdl` to lock after
five minutes and before system sleep:

```kdl
autostart {
    command "swayidle" "-w" "timeout" "300" "ferese-lock" "before-sleep" "ferese-lock" "lock" "ferese-lock"
}
```

Test password unlocking before enabling automatic locking. The installer provides
`/etc/pam.d/ferese-lock` and preserves an existing administrator policy.

## Inactivity and display sleep

Locked displays dim after 30 seconds without input and sleep after 120 seconds.
Keyboard, pointer, or touch activity wakes them without unlocking. Set either
delay to zero to disable it, in Settings or KDL:

```kdl
lock-screen {
    dim-after-seconds 30
    sleep-after-seconds 120
}
```

Both delays start when the session locks, separately from the automatic-lock timer.
Display sleep does not suspend the computer. A nested preview shows black
instead of powering off the host display.

## Recovery and limits

The lock covers all displays, including displays connected after locking. If the
lock UI crashes, the compositor keeps the session protected and allows a replacement
locker to take over. A running locker cannot be replaced. To recover, launch
`ferese-lock` with the affected session's Wayland environment. You can also end the
session from another TTY; see [Recovery](installation.md#logout-and-recovery).

The locker reports readiness only after protocol confirmation. At that point,
every connected output has presented protected content, or there are no outputs.
The pinned Iced runtime also emits a synthetic `Locked` event when it sends the
request. The locker keeps a two-event guard until upstream separates that event
from protocol confirmation. Dependency upgrades must re-audit this workaround.

Password messages use zeroizing storage. Avatar files are limited to 8 MiB,
4096 pixels per dimension, and a 32 MiB decoding budget. The clock updates at
minute boundaries; authentication retry deadlines are independent.

When restricted clients are introduced, their registry must omit
`ext_session_lock_manager_v1`. This restriction is deferred until that client
classification exists.

The password interface does not support password changes or interactive
multi-factor prompts. Update expired credentials outside the locker.

Developers should validate locking and readiness against
[ext-session-lock-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-session-lock-v1).
See [Development](development.md) for tests.
